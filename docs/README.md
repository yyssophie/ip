## Features

### Adding a Todo

**Format:** `todo <description>`

**Example:**
```
todo read book
```

### Adding a Deadline

**Format:** `deadline <description> /by <date time>`

Sloth supports flexible date formats:
- `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` (e.g., `2025-04-18 14:30`)
- `MMM dd yyyy, HH:mm` (e.g., `Apr 18 2025, 14:30`)
- `d/M/yyyy HH:mm` (e.g., `18/4/2025 14:30`)
- Date-only formats automatically default to midnight (00:00)

**Date-only format examples:**
- `2025-04-18` becomes `2025-04-18 00:00` (midnight)
- `Apr 18 2025` becomes `Apr 18 2025, 00:00` (midnight)
- `MMM d yyyy` format like `Jan 5 2025` becomes `Jan 5 2025, 00:00`

This is perfect when you know the due date but don't need a specific time - Sloth will treat it as due at the start of that day.

**Examples:**
```
deadline return book /by 2025-04-18 18:00
deadline submit assignment /by Apr 18 2025, 23:59
deadline pay rent /by 2025-05-01
deadline doctor appointment /by Dec 15 2024
```

### Adding an Event

**Format:** `event <description> /from <start time> /to <end time>`

**Example:**
```
event project meeting /from 2025-04-18 10:00 /to 2025-04-18 12:00
```

### Listing All Tasks

Shows all tasks currently stored.

### Marking Tasks as Done/Undone
